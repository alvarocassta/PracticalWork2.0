# PractiWeb Page Practice:             



Description of my work:

 I have been thinking of making a web page for something I have been doing for a while now. After doing some research on the different units of the subject I started making the web page. I decided to make a web page where you can interact and move between different pages. Also i looked down more information on web pages on youtube so i could make a good page. After making all the files needed for the making of the web page I started the index.html and all the different boxes and categories needed. Such as About us, Topic, Contact etcâ€¦ 
The css is the tool I used to make my page look better and also to make everything fit in its place.

Problems on my web page:

The first problem I had was that I had problems understanding the CSS box modeling. When in class Oliver explained it I thought it was easy but putting it in practice was more difficult. 

The second problem I had was that by the time I wanted to put my logo on the navbar, the logo was huge and even by the time I put less width on it, it didn't fit on the navbar. The solution I had for it was making the navbar bigger so I could fit the logo. 

The third problem I had was that when I was in the middle of the project, I remembered that I didn't have the folder in the correct way so I had to create new ones and put all my work in those ones.

All the github procedure for uploading the page was kind of a pain in the back since i didn't know that once you uploaded there all the changes you make had to be actualice in there. 





Conclusion:

 The conclusion I have of this project is that I really like it because I see myself doing a web page when I'm older so I can use it for my benefit, such as making my own small company or making money from making them for other people. I think the practical part of this subject is great information for informatic engineering and it is very entertaining to learn from it.

Another conclusion I got from making this page it's that it's really useful to learn different opinions on the internet because people discuss how it's better to make the perfect web page.
